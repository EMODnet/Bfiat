title: Bfiat, An R package for bottom fishing assessment
description: >
     Bfiat, the Bottom Fisheries Impact Assessment Tool, is an R-package that 
     estimates the impact of bottom trawling on sediment inhabiting organisms, 
     and on sediment ecosystem functions. 
     It contains data-driven mechanistic models that describe how species 
     density is being reduced by bottom trawling, and then recovers till 
     the next fishing event.

## Introduction

```         
 Bfiat (Bottom Fisheries Impact Assessment Tool) is an R-package that 
 estimates the impact of bottom trawling on sediment inhabiting organisms, 
 and on sediment ecosystem functions. 
 It contains data-driven mechanistic models that describe how species 
 density is being reduced by bottom trawling, and then recovers till 
 the next fishing event.

<br>

<br> The R-package Bfiat is created in the framework of the EMODnet
biology project, the NECCTON (New Copernicus Capability for Trophic
Ocean Networks) project, and in cooperation with the ICES Working Group
on Fisheries Benthic Impact and Trade-offs (WGFBIT).

## Installation

Before installing the *Bfiat* package, you need to first install the
following R-packages and their dependencies:

-   *Btrait*, to work with species data, and for the trait databases (to
    be found on github/EMODNET/btrait).
-   *deSolve*, to solve the mechanistic model
-   *devtools*, required for a seamless installation of the Bfiat and
    Btrait packages from this github repository.

<br><br> Once the deSolve and devtools packages have been installed
(from CRAN), type the following command in the R-console to install the
*Btrait* and *Bfiat* package:

```         
devtools::install_github("EMODnet/Btrait", depend=TRUE, build_vignettes=TRUE)
devtools::install_github("EMODnet/Bfiat", depend=TRUE, build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

If you do not want to install the vignettes, then you may delete the
*build_vignettes = TRUE* part.

Then, type `require(Bfiat)` in the R-console to load the package in R.

That's it! After this step, you should be able to use the package.

<br>

## Getting help

As for any other R-package, you can get extra help by entering `?Bfiat`
in the R console.

There is a vignette in the package, that can be triggered with
`vignette("Btrait")` in the R console.

## Uninstall

To uninstall the *Bfiat* package, locate it in the "Packages" tab in
*Rstudio*, and click on the encircled "x" button ("Remove package") on
the right margin.

To uninstall the package manually, type the following command in the
R-console (the version of the library may differ, here we assume 4.1):

-   Windows users:

    ```         
    remove.packages("Bfiat", lib="~/R/win-library/4.1")
    ```

-   Linux users:

    ```         
    remove.packages("Bfiat", lib="~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.1")
    ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the transition from version 0.01 to version 1.0.0 the names of
many functions have changed. Also, the function names in package Btrait,
used by Bfiat, have changed. This means that any code that uses these
old versions will need to be adapted.
